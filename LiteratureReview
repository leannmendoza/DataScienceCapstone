Reference 1: Small Business Awareness and Adoption of state-of-the-art Technologies in Emerging and Developing markets, and Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic

Akpan (2020) highlights the challenges faced by small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) in developing economies and emerging markets when it comes to adopting digital technologies. Despite the success stories in some emerging markets, SMEs struggle to adopt advanced technologies and innovations necessary for improving business operations and re-engineering processes. The article highlights the use of financial technology (FinTech) and analytical algorithms in manufacturing and service industries to improve processes. 

Many SOTA technologies like cloud computing, big data, predictive analytics, disruptive computing, data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT), common in advanced economies, are still not widely adopted in developing economies and emerging markets. This gap in technology adoption was particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic when businesses in these regions were severely impacted due to the lack of digital infrastructure. The article suggests that embracing these advanced technologies is crucial for SMEs in these areas to survive the challenges of the post-COVID-19 era and compete globally.

Relevance to the research topic:
This paper can serve as a reference when I make the point that it is imperative that SMEs adapt to emerging technologies, especially when new emerging technology involved harnessing insights from data. 

Reference 2: Leveraging Business Data Analytics and Machine Learning Techniques for Competitive Advantage: Case Study Evidence from Small Businesses.

This paper focuses on the application and benefits of data analytics and machine learning techniques in small businesses. The research aims to explore how small businesses, particularly in healthcare and retail, can also harness these technologies for competitive advantage as data analytics is typically associated with large organizations. Despite the extensive benefits of data analytics being well-documented for large firms SMEs have not fully realized the potential gains from implementing data analytics and machine learning. By employing the case study method, the paper provides detailed insights into how small businesses in healthcare and retail can leverage data analytics and machine learning for better decision-making and gaining a competitive edge.

Relevance to the research topic:
This paper supports my point that small businesses can and should be empowered by their own data.


Reference 3: The State of Small Business in America (U.S. Chamber of Commerce)

In the United States, small businesses constitute a substantial segment of the commercial sector, with 33.2 million entities accounting for 99.9% of all American businesses. These enterprises are instrumental in driving employment growth, having generated approximately 63% of all new jobs from 1995 to 2021. The year 2021 witnessed a significant uptick in entrepreneurial initiatives, evidenced by a record 5.4 million new business applications. Concurrently, there's an increasing consumer propensity towards patronizing local businesses, reflecting a trend towards supporting community-based enterprises.

Relevance to the research topic:
This paper can be used to reference and illuminate the market share that could benefit from being empowered by their own data.


Reference 4: Small Business Index Q4 2023 (U.S. Chamber of Commerce)

Two main pinpoints small businesses face is 1) rising cost due to inflation and 2) worker shortage. Deploying low-cost technology for struggling businesses is imperative to adapt to the current market.
